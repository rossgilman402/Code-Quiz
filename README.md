Homework 4: Web API

## Description

This project is meant to display my Web API skills using the Document Object Model. It is a simple quiz game that will have a timer and iterate through a list of objects that contain the questions, options, and solutions. When the user runs out of time and or finishes all of the questions they can enter in their initials to add to the leaderboard. The leaderboard will be stored in local storage so that when the user closes the game it will be saved.

## Installation

To install the code please visit https://github.com/rossgilman402/Code-Quiz. Then the user should in their terminal in their personal directory enter - git clone https://github.com/rossgilman402/Code-Quiz.git. The user can then run the program by opening the index.html file in their desired web explorer. Or, the user can visit the website https://rossgilman.com/Code-Quiz/ to use the program directly.

## Usage

This program is a fun and interative HTML, CSS and JavaScript quiz. It contains a dynamic leaderboard for highscores.
